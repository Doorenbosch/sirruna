    "the_lead": "Bitcoin retreated through $90,000 overnight as Asian markets delivered the correction European desks spent last week claiming they wanted. The 2.1% drawdown \u2014 unremarkable by historical standards \u2014 arrived on thin volume during the Tokyo session, with Solana taking the harder hit at 4.6% as risk appetite contracted across the board. Total market capitalisation shed $67 billion in twelve hours, yet the move feels less like distribution and more like a market catching its breath after a 3.9% weekly advance. European institutional flows have been notably absent during this consolidation, with MiCA-compliant venues reporting subdued activity as firms await clearer guidance on custody requirements. The setup entering London hours is a market that has corrected in price but not in structure \u2014 BTC dominance holds firm at 57%, suggesting capital rotation rather than genuine risk-off behaviour. Today hinges on whether European desks treat this as the entry point they claimed to want, or whether the bid remains perpetually five percent lower.",

    "the_angle": "Every institutional desk in Mayfair spent November insisting they would add exposure on any meaningful pullback. Now that pullback has arrived \u2014 modest, orderly, on declining volume \u2014 and the silence is instructive. The issue is not price but process: MiCA implementation has created a compliance bottleneck where capital allocation decisions require three layers of approval that did not exist six months ago. European institutions are not bearish. They are bureaucratically constrained. The dip will be bought, just not by the people who said they would buy it.",
    "the_angle_title": "The Dip That Reveals the Bluff",
    "the_driver": "\u2022 Asian session selling concentrated in perpetual futures rather than spot markets, with funding rates remaining neutral \u2014 a pattern suggesting leveraged position adjustment rather than fundamental de-risking by holders.\n\u2022 Ethereum's relative outperformance during the drawdown (down 1.7% versus Bitcoin's 2.1%) marks a subtle shift from recent weeks, potentially reflecting European institutional preference for ETH exposure given clearer MiCA classification pathways.\n\u2022 Dubai-based OTC desks reported elevated inquiry volume from sovereign-adjacent entities during the pullback, though conversion to executed trades remained limited \u2014 consistent with the region's pattern of using dips for price discovery rather than immediate accumulation.\n\u2022 UK regulatory commentary from the FCA's crypto lead yesterday suggested a more accommodative stance on institutional custody solutions, a development that received minimal market attention but may prove significant for Q1 positioning.",
    "the_driver_title": "What Actually Moved Markets",
    "the_signal": "\u2022 Fear and Greed Index at 69 (Greed) \u2014 down from 75 last week, suggesting sentiment is cooling without capitulating, the kind of reset that typically precedes continuation rather than reversal.\n\u2022 ETH/BTC ratio at 0.0344 \u2014 holding above November lows despite broader weakness, a quiet signal that the altcoin rotation thesis is not dead, merely dormant.\n\u2022 24-hour volume at $112B represents a 23% decline from last week's average \u2014 thin liquidity amplified overnight moves, but also means less conviction behind the selling.",
    "the_signal_title": "Three Numbers That Matter",
    "the_takeaway": "Markets do not reward investors for wanting to buy the dip; they reward investors for buying it \u2014 and the gap between intention and execution has rarely been wider in European crypto.",
