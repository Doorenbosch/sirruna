    "the_session": "\u2022 Bitcoin drifted 0.5% lower to $90,151 during European hours, unable to reclaim the psychological $91,000 level despite three attempts during London's morning session \u2014 a pattern of gentle distribution rather than aggressive selling.\n\n\u2022 Ethereum outperformed modestly at $3,107, gaining 0.6% and narrowing the ratio against Bitcoin, though the move lacked the volume conviction that typically signals sustained rotation into alts.\n\n\u2022 Solana sat perfectly flat at $133, an unusual stillness for an asset that has traded with elevated volatility since November \u2014 the kind of pause that often precedes directional resolution.\n\n\u2022 Total market capitalisation edged up 0.2% to $3.17 trillion while BTC dominance held firm at 56.9%, suggesting capital is neither fleeing to safety nor chasing risk with any urgency.\n\n\u2022 Liquidation data showed balanced positioning with neither bulls nor bears taking significant pain \u2014 the market appears to be waiting for a catalyst rather than forcing one.",

    "the_macro": "\u2022 US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded modest net inflows for the fifth consecutive session, with BlackRock's IBIT continuing to absorb the bulk of institutional demand \u2014 a steady accumulation pattern that has replaced the dramatic swings of early 2024.\n\n\u2022 Federal Reserve commentary remained hawkish-adjacent, with Governor Waller suggesting rate cuts may come slower than markets had priced, keeping risk assets in a holding pattern through the US afternoon.\n\n\u2022 The dollar index strengthened marginally against major currencies, creating mild headwinds for crypto priced in USD terms \u2014 though the correlation has weakened notably since the post-election rally.\n\n\u2022 Treasury yields ticked higher across the curve, with the 10-year approaching 4.45%, a level that historically introduces friction for non-yielding assets like Bitcoin.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets traded sideways, with the S&P 500 digesting recent gains near all-time highs \u2014 crypto's muted response suggests it is trading on its own technicals rather than simply mirroring risk sentiment.",
