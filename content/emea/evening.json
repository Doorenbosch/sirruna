    "the_session": "\u2022 Bitcoin slipped 2.6% to $90,554 during European hours, surrendering the $93,000 level it had defended through Asian trading \u2014 a clean technical breakdown that triggered roughly $180 million in long liquidations across major exchanges.\n\n\u2022 Ethereum bore the heavier burden with a 5.6% decline to $3,204, widening the performance gap against Bitcoin and pushing ETH/BTC to its lowest ratio since late October \u2014 a dynamic that typically signals risk appetite contracting rather than rotating.\n\n\u2022 Market capitalisation shed $88 billion to settle at $3.17 trillion, with BTC dominance climbing to 56.9% as capital consolidated into the largest asset \u2014 the defensive posture traders adopt when conviction wavers.\n\n\u2022 Volume patterns told a story of orderly de-risking rather than panic: spot selling dominated over derivatives liquidations, and bid depth on major pairs remained intact through the London session, suggesting institutional desks were trimming rather than fleeing.",

    "the_macro": "\u2022 The dollar index extended gains for a third consecutive session as traders repriced Fed rate expectations following Wednesday's hawkish minutes \u2014 a headwind that historically correlates with crypto weakness as the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets rises.\n\n\u2022 US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their first meaningful outflow day this week, with preliminary data suggesting $95 million in net redemptions \u2014 modest in context but notable as the first crack in what had been relentless institutional accumulation.\n\n\u2022 Treasury yields climbed across the curve with the 10-year touching 4.45%, creating the kind of risk-free competition that draws capital from speculative assets; crypto markets have shown particular sensitivity to moves above 4.4% this cycle.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets offered no shelter, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both trading lower into US midday \u2014 the correlation between crypto and tech remaining stubbornly high despite narratives of Bitcoin as an uncorrelated store of value.",
