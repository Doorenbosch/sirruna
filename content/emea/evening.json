    "the_session": "\u2022 Bitcoin drifted lower through European hours, settling at $92,683 after briefly testing $94,000 support during the London morning \u2014 a measured pullback following last week's push toward six figures that suggests profit-taking rather than conviction selling.\n\n\u2022 Ethereum held its ground better than the broader market, posting a modest 0.4% gain while most majors bled red \u2014 a divergence that coincides with renewed attention on spot ETH ETF positioning ahead of year-end rebalancing.\n\n\u2022 Solana bore the session's heaviest losses among large caps, dropping 3.3% on no obvious catalyst beyond the rotation out of higher-beta names that typically accompanies cautious tape.\n\n\u2022 Total market capitalisation shed $50 billion to $3.25 trillion, with BTC dominance ticking up to 56.6% \u2014 the flight-to-quality pattern that tends to emerge when risk appetite cools but conviction in the cycle remains intact.",

    "the_macro": "\u2022 US equity futures traded sideways through European hours as markets awaited fresh direction, with the S&P 500 hovering near all-time highs \u2014 the kind of consolidation that keeps crypto in a holding pattern absent its own catalysts.\n\n\u2022 The dollar index stabilised after last week's retreat, removing a tailwind that had supported risk assets including crypto; traders are now pricing in a more measured Fed easing path through 2025.\n\n\u2022 US spot Bitcoin ETF flows remained robust in early data, with BlackRock's IBIT continuing to attract steady inflows \u2014 institutional demand that has provided a floor under prices even as retail sentiment cools.\n\n\u2022 Treasury yields edged higher in early US trading, with the 10-year pushing back toward 4.5%, a level that historically creates headwinds for non-yielding assets like Bitcoin.",
