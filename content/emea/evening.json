    "the_day": "Digital assets posted their strongest single-day gains in weeks, with Bitcoin climbing above $92k and Ethereum reclaiming $3k. The move came after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most countries, sparking a broader risk-on rotation. Crypto led equity markets higher, with altcoins posting double-digit gains across the board.",
    "the_move_explained": "The tariff reprieve removed a significant near-term macro overhang that had kept institutional capital defensive. Markets interpreted the pause as reducing recession risk and signaling policy flexibility. Crypto's outperformance suggests leveraged positioning had been cleared out during recent weeks of consolidation, allowing for explosive upside on relatively modest catalysts.",
    "into_tonight": "Futures remain firm in Asian trading hours. The key question is whether this represents renewed conviction or simply a technical relief rally into resistance levels that have proven sticky since February."
