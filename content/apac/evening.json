    "the_session": "\u2022 Ethereum surged 7.7% to reclaim $3,345, its strongest single-session performance in three weeks \u2014 a move that pulled the broader altcoin complex higher and compressed Bitcoin dominance below 57% for the first time since late November.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin pushed through $92,000 with relative ease during Hong Kong morning hours, finding buyers on each dip toward $91,500 \u2014 the kind of methodical bid-side support that suggests institutional accumulation rather than retail chasing.\n\n\u2022 Solana's 4.8% gain to $139 came on elevated volume through Singapore afternoon trading, with on-chain data showing renewed activity in its DeFi protocols after weeks of dormancy.\n\n\u2022 Total market capitalisation added $105 billion to reach $3.27 trillion, though the rally unfolded without the liquidation cascades that typically accompany moves of this magnitude \u2014 short interest had already been flushed in last week's volatility.",

    "the_macro": "\u2022 The Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes, released during US hours, revealed growing comfort with the current rate trajectory \u2014 language that markets interpreted as confirmation that the hiking cycle remains firmly concluded, sending Treasury yields lower and risk assets higher.\n\n\u2022 The dollar index slipped 0.4% overnight, its third consecutive session of weakness, providing a tailwind for crypto assets that have traded with increasing sensitivity to currency moves since the ETF approvals.\n\n\u2022 US spot Bitcoin ETF flows turned positive again on Wednesday, with preliminary data suggesting approximately $380 million in net inflows \u2014 a reversal from the modest outflows that characterised the holiday-shortened trading week.\n\n\u2022 European Central Bank officials maintained their hawkish rhetoric in Davos side meetings, but markets appear to have priced in the divergence between Fed and ECB policy paths, limiting the impact on risk sentiment.",
