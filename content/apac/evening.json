    "the_session": "\u2022 Bitcoin pushed through $92,500 during Hong Kong afternoon trading, its highest level in three days, with the move accelerating after European desks handed off to a relatively thin Asian session \u2014 suggesting conviction rather than volume drove the bid.\n\n\u2022 Solana's 5.5% gain outpaced the majors by a comfortable margin, with on-chain data showing renewed activity in its DeFi ecosystem after weeks of dormancy; the SOL/ETH ratio touched levels not seen since early November.\n\n\u2022 Ethereum followed Bitcoin's lead but with less enthusiasm, the 1.6% gain leaving it still struggling to decisively clear $3,300 \u2014 a level that has rejected rallies twice this week.\n\n\u2022 Liquidation data remained muted despite the move higher, with roughly $45 million in shorts cleared across major exchanges; the lack of a squeeze suggests this was organic buying rather than mechanical short-covering.\n\n\u2022 BTC dominance held steady at 57.1%, indicating altcoins participated proportionally in the rally rather than either leading or lagging \u2014 the kind of broad lift that typically signals macro-driven risk appetite rather than crypto-specific catalysts.",

    "the_macro": "\u2022 The dollar index slipped 0.3% during Asian hours, extending its weekly decline and providing tailwinds for risk assets broadly; crypto has tracked DXY inversely with unusual fidelity over the past fortnight.\n\n\u2022 US Treasury yields drifted lower overnight after softer-than-expected jobless claims data, reinforcing market bets that the Federal Reserve's hiking cycle is definitively over \u2014 fed funds futures now price March cuts at 68% probability.\n\n\u2022 BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF recorded its fifteenth consecutive day of net inflows according to preliminary data, with the cumulative haul now exceeding $2.1 billion; the steady institutional bid has provided a floor under prices during recent consolidation.\n\n\u2022 European Central Bank officials maintained their hawkish rhetoric in overnight comments, but markets largely shrugged \u2014 the divergence between Fed and ECB policy paths is now consensus rather than catalyst.\n\n\u2022 Gold touched $2,050 during the session, its highest since May, moving in tandem with Bitcoin in what has become an increasingly correlated trade on dollar weakness and real rate expectations.",
