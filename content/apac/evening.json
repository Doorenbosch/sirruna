    "the_session": "\u2022 Bitcoin slipped 2.3% to $90,444 during Asian hours, breaching the $91,000 level that had held as psychological support since last week's consolidation \u2014 a move that triggered roughly $180 million in long liquidations across major exchanges.\n\n\u2022 Ethereum underperformed the session with a 4.1% decline to $3,119, widening the ETH/BTC ratio to levels not seen since early November as traders rotated back toward Bitcoin dominance, now sitting at 57%.\n\n\u2022 Solana shed 3.4% to $134, though the decline was orderly compared to smaller caps, suggesting the pullback reflects broad risk-off sentiment rather than project-specific concerns.\n\n\u2022 Total market capitalisation contracted by $64 billion to $3.17 trillion, with the Fear & Greed Index cooling from \"Greed\" territory \u2014 a recalibration that veteran traders will recognise as healthy after weeks of one-directional momentum.",

    "the_macro": "\u2022 The dollar index held near two-week highs heading into the Asian session, applying familiar pressure on crypto and other risk assets as traders positioned ahead of tomorrow's US jobless claims data.\n\n\u2022 Federal Reserve minutes released late Wednesday revealed officials remain cautious about the pace of rate cuts, with several members noting inflation risks have not fully dissipated \u2014 language that tempered expectations for aggressive easing in 2025.\n\n\u2022 US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded modest net outflows of approximately $45 million on Wednesday, breaking a three-day inflow streak and suggesting institutional buyers are pausing rather than panicking at current levels.\n\n\u2022 Treasury yields stabilised after their recent climb, with the 10-year settling around 4.42%, providing a less volatile backdrop but no immediate catalyst for crypto to reclaim lost ground.",
