  "sections": {
    "the_session": "Crypto markets posted their strongest single-day gains in weeks, with Bitcoin pushing toward $94k and Ethereum outpacing at +9.3%. The rally mirrored broader risk asset strength across equities and commodities. Volume was consistent with genuine buying rather than short covering, though remained below levels seen during previous breakouts.",
    "the_flows": "Institutional flows showed conviction rather than speculation. ETF inflows across the major Bitcoin products totaled over $200 million, with BlackRock's IBIT leading. Perpetual funding rates normalized after yesterday's flush, suggesting leveraged positioning has reset to healthier levels. Stablecoin flows into exchanges picked up meaningfully in the final hours of trading.",
    "the_divergence": "The day's most notable divergence: Ethereum's outperformance wasn't driven by any ETH-specific catalyst. When ETH leads in a risk-on environment, it typically signals rotation down the risk curve rather than a flight to quality. Korean exchange premiums returned to positive territory for the first time this week.",
    "the_regime_check": "Today's move suggests the correction phase may be ending, but one day doesn't make a trend. The market absorbed recent Fed commentary suggesting rate policy has reached terminal hawkishness for this cycle. The dollar weakened correspondingly, removing a key headwind for digital assets.",
    "the_overnight_setup": "Asian markets open to positive momentum, though liquidity typically thins into the weekend. The psychological $95k level for Bitcoin remains the near-term test. A clean break above with volume would suggest the correction is definitively over.",
    "the_takeaway": "Today was pure macro correlation working in crypto's favor. Enjoy it, but remember: the fundamental thesis hasn't changed—we're still waiting for the next catalyst."
