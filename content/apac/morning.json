    "the_lead": "Bitcoin shed 2.8% overnight as US markets closed out a session defined more by profit-taking than panic, pulling back from last week's push toward $93,000 to settle at $90,357. The move accelerated during European hours, with Ethereum bearing the heavier burden at -5.3%, a divergence that speaks to rotational dynamics rather than broad risk-off sentiment. BTC dominance climbing to 57.1% confirms what Asian desks suspected: capital isn't leaving crypto, it's consolidating toward the perceived safer asset within the complex.\n\nAsia opens to a curious setup. Hong Kong's spot ETF volumes have been thinning for three consecutive sessions, suggesting local institutional appetite is waiting rather than chasing. Tokyo remains in its post-holiday drift, while Korean retail\u2014often the canary for speculative excess\u2014shows subdued exchange inflows according to overnight CryptoQuant data. The $3.16 trillion total market cap represents an orderly 2.2% compression, not the cascading liquidations that would signal genuine stress.\n\nToday hinges on whether Asian hours treat this as a buying opportunity or confirm the overnight weakness. With US and European traders absent until tonight, the next twelve hours belong to this region alone.",

    "the_angle": "Consensus this morning frames the pullback as healthy consolidation after Bitcoin's November surge\u2014the market taking a breath before the next leg higher. Here's what that misses: healthy consolidation requires sellers, and the overnight volume profile suggests the selling came from a narrow cohort of short-term holders, not the institutional base that drove the rally. When a dip arrives precisely when everyone said a dip should arrive, the question isn't whether to buy it\u2014it's why so few are.",

    "the_driver": "\u2022 ETH's underperformance (-5.3% versus BTC's -2.8%) marks the fifth session in six where the ratio has compressed, pushing ETH/BTC toward 0.034\u2014a level that historically precedes either capitulation or sharp mean reversion, with little middle ground.\n\n\u2022 Perpetual funding rates across major exchanges have reset to near-neutral after running hot last week, clearing the overcrowded long positioning that made the market vulnerable to exactly this kind of shakeout.\n\n\u2022 The $142 billion in 24-hour volume represents a 15% decline from the weekly average, suggesting this move happened on lighter participation\u2014often a sign that the trend remains intact rather than reversing.\n\n\u2022 Chinese economic data released at 09:30 SGT showed manufacturing PMI holding at 50.3, neither stimulus-inducing nor growth-confirming, leaving the macro backdrop for regional risk assets essentially unchanged.",

    "the_signal": "\u2022 Fear & Greed Index at 79 (Extreme Greed) \u2014 still elevated despite the pullback, indicating sentiment hasn't reset enough to call this a true flush.\n\n\u2022 BTC spot ETF flows turned negative Monday (-$89m) \u2014 the first outflow day in eight sessions, though modest enough to read as rebalancing rather than redemption.\n\n\u2022 Open interest down 4.2% overnight \u2014 leverage is being reduced voluntarily, which tends to build a healthier base for continuation than forced liquidations would.",
