        "fulcrum": "Friday's jobs report looms as the macro fulcrum. Weak data strengthens the rate-cut case and likely supports risk assets; strong data gives the Fed cover to pause and could extend the current correction. Either outcome moves crypto—the question is direction.",
        "levels": "BTC $82,000 is the line. Below it, momentum traders capitulate and the next support is $75,000—the pre-election breakout level. Above $92,000, shorts get squeezed and the narrative flips back to bull. ETH $3,000 is psychological; losing it confirms the rotation out of alts continues.",
        "unpriced": "Stablecoin supply is quietly expanding while prices fall. USDT market cap hit a new all-time high this week. This divergence historically precedes accumulation phases. The market is focused on price; the smart money is watching liquidity.",
        "wildcard": "MicroStrategy's inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 on December 23 could create forced buying from index funds. The reflexive loop—MSTR buys BTC, stock rises, can borrow more, buys more BTC—may have one more chapter."
