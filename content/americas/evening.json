    "the_session": "\u2022 Ethereum posted its strongest single-day performance in weeks, climbing 6.6% to reclaim $3,300 \u2014 a level that had served as stubborn resistance since early December, with the breakout accompanied by a notable uptick in spot volume on major exchanges.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin advanced 2.2% to $92,769, consolidating above the $90,000 psychological floor that had attracted dip buyers throughout the Asian session; the move lacked the urgency of ETH's rally but carried the steady bid characteristic of institutional accumulation windows.\n\n\u2022 BTC dominance slipped to 56.8% as capital rotated into alts, with Solana gaining 3.8% to $138 \u2014 the kind of broad-based strength that typically signals improving risk appetite rather than isolated speculation.\n\n\u2022 Total crypto market capitalisation expanded to $3.26 trillion, adding roughly $80 billion in 24 hours; the Fear & Greed Index edged back toward neutral territory after spending much of last week in cautious mode.",

    "the_macro": "\u2022 The dollar index retreated 0.3% ahead of tomorrow's FOMC minutes release, providing a tailwind for risk assets including crypto; traders are parsing whether December's hawkish hold will be reinforced or softened by the committee's internal debate.\n\n\u2022 US equity markets closed mixed with the S&P 500 flat and Nasdaq up 0.4%, as tech strength offset weakness in defensive sectors \u2014 the rotation pattern that has historically correlated with crypto's better days.\n\n\u2022 Treasury yields held steady with the 10-year at 4.58%, offering no fresh catalyst but maintaining the elevated rate environment that continues to shape institutional allocation decisions toward digital assets.\n\n\u2022 European Central Bank officials signalled patience on rate cuts despite softening inflation data, keeping the transatlantic monetary divergence narrative alive and supporting dollar-denominated asset flows.",
