    "the_session": "\u2022 Bitcoin slipped 2.3% to $90,381, surrendering the $92,000 level it had defended for much of the Asian session \u2014 a retreat that coincided with softer equity futures and renewed dollar strength heading into the US close.\n\n\u2022 Ethereum bore the heavier burden at -4.3%, dropping to $3,093 as the ETH/BTC ratio compressed further; the underperformance continues a pattern that has persisted since early December, with capital rotating toward Bitcoin's relative safety.\n\n\u2022 Total market capitalisation shed $71 billion to $3.16 trillion, though BTC dominance ticked up to 57.1% \u2014 the flight-to-quality within crypto that typically signals risk-off positioning rather than outright capitulation.\n\n\u2022 Liquidations remained contained at roughly $180 million across major exchanges over 24 hours, suggesting this move reflects spot selling pressure rather than leveraged cascade; open interest on CME Bitcoin futures held steady near recent highs.\n\n\u2022 The Fear & Greed Index eased to 69 from 74 yesterday, still in \"Greed\" territory but cooling \u2014 a recalibration that market veterans tend to view as healthy consolidation rather than trend reversal.",

    "the_macro": "\u2022 The DXY dollar index climbed 0.4% to 107.2, its highest level in three weeks, as traders positioned for tomorrow's PCE inflation print \u2014 the Fed's preferred gauge that could reshape January rate expectations.\n\n\u2022 Treasury yields pushed higher across the curve, with the 10-year touching 4.58%, creating the familiar headwind for risk assets that has characterised much of December's choppy trading.\n\n\u2022 Fed Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated her preference for a cautious approach to further cuts, noting persistent inflation concerns \u2014 comments that reinforced the \"higher for longer\" narrative that has tempered crypto's post-election enthusiasm.\n\n\u2022 European markets closed mixed ahead of the holiday break, with the Stoxx 600 flat as thin liquidity amplified modest moves; Asian futures point to a subdued open.\n\n\u2022 Gold held firm at $2,618 despite dollar strength, a divergence that suggests some investors are hedging against both inflation and growth concerns heading into year-end.",

        "content": "\u2022 US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded estimated net outflows of $287 million Thursday, marking the third consecutive day of redemptions after last week's record inflows \u2014 a cooling that analysts attribute to year-end profit-taking rather than fundamental repositioning.\n\n\u2022 BlackRock's IBIT saw modest inflows of approximately $42 million, continuing its streak as the preferred vehicle for institutional allocation, while Grayscale's GBTC experienced outflows of $158 million as the rotation trade persists.\n\n\u2022 MicroStrategy shares fell 4.8% to $332 ahead of its expected inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 index next week, with some traders unwinding positions after the announcement rally; the company now holds over 439,000 BTC on its balance sheet.\n\n\u2022 The SEC remained quiet on pending spot Ethereum ETF options applications, with the January 25 deadline approaching for several issuers \u2014 a decision that could unlock significant institutional hedging demand.\n\n\u2022 Canadian Bitcoin miners reported mixed Q4 production figures, with Hut 8 noting increased difficulty rates compressed margins despite stable BTC prices through mid-December."
