    "the_session": "Bitcoin spent the US session consolidating gains after Thursday's sharp dip below $87,000, grinding steadily back toward the $91,000 handle without conviction. The move felt more like short covering than fresh accumulation, with price action tethered to a narrow $89,800-$91,200 range through New York hours. Equities offered little directional guidance\u2014the S&P 500 drifted sideways ahead of next week's CPI print\u2014leaving crypto to trade on its own technicals. Ethereum showed relative strength, reclaiming $3,100 with more purpose, while Solana's 1.7% gain masked intraday chop. Volume remained subdued, roughly 15% below the 20-day average, suggesting traders are content to wait rather than chase.",
    "the_session_title": "A Measured Grind Higher After Thursday's Flush",
    "the_flows": "The week's ETF story is one of deceleration rather than reversal. Friday saw an estimated $145 million in net inflows across US spot Bitcoin ETFs, a notable step down from the $350 million-plus days that characterized late November. BlackRock's IBIT absorbed the lion's share at approximately $95 million, while Fidelity's FBTC added an estimated $65 million. Grayscale's GBTC saw modest outflows of roughly $15 million\u2014its smallest bleed in weeks\u2014suggesting the conversion trade may finally be exhausting itself. The five-day pattern reveals a market catching its breath: Monday's $485 million surge gave way to progressively smaller inflows through Friday. Cumulative week flows remain solidly positive at approximately $1.1 billion, but the trajectory matters. On-chain data shows exchange balances continuing their structural decline, down another 8,400 BTC this week. Whale wallets holding 1,000+ BTC have been net accumulators since Wednesday's dip, a constructive signal beneath the surface.",
    "the_flows_title": "ETF Inflows Decelerate But Remain Positive",
    "the_divergence": "The day's most interesting signal came from ETH/BTC, which posted its strongest daily gain in two weeks despite no obvious catalyst. Ethereum's 2.8% advance against Bitcoin's 1.1% breaks a pattern of persistent underperformance that has defined Q4. The ratio remains deeply depressed at 0.0344, but today's move suggests some rotation appetite may be emerging. Equally notable: Solana failed to participate in the alt-coin bid, unusual given its recent momentum leadership. DeFi tokens broadly outperformed layer-1s, with the DeFi Pulse Index up 3.2%. This divergence\u2014ETH and DeFi leading while SOL lags\u2014hints at capital seeking yield and utility rather than pure momentum plays. Whether this persists through the weekend will reveal if it's signal or noise. The correlation between BTC and the Nasdaq, which had tightened to 0.78 last week, loosened notably today to 0.61.",

    "the_regime_check": "We remain in the same post-$100K-rejection consolidation regime that began last weekend. Realized volatility has compressed from 72% to 58% over five sessions\u2014a healthy digestion pattern rather than a warning sign. The funding rate on perpetuals has normalized to 0.01% after spiking to 0.08% during the euphoric push toward six figures, suggesting leverage has been flushed. Options markets tell a similar story: the 25-delta skew has flattened, with puts and calls now roughly equally priced for the first time since mid-November. This is a market finding equilibrium rather than building toward imminent directional resolution. The $88,000 level has now been tested and held twice this week, establishing it as near-term structural support.",
    "the_regime_check_title": "Consolidation Regime Intact, Volatility Compressing",
    "the_overnight_setup": "Asian markets inherit a technically balanced setup. The immediate level to watch is $89,500\u2014a clean break below likely triggers another test of Thursday's $86,800 low. Resistance clusters around $91,800, where sellers have consistently emerged this week. Weekend liquidity thins considerably after Singapore hours, creating conditions for outsized moves on modest volume. The calendar is light until Monday's China trade data, though any geopolitical headlines from the Middle East could inject volatility. CME futures close at $90,650, creating a small gap that typically gets filled early in Sunday's session. For positioning, the risk-reward favors patience: this consolidation needs time to resolve, and chasing either direction here offers poor odds.",
    "the_overnight_setup_title": "Watch $89,500 Support Into Asia Open",
    "the_takeaway": "Today confirmed what Thursday's bounce suggested: the market has found a floor but lacks the conviction to push higher. The $88,000-$92,000 range is now the battlefield. Resolution likely awaits next week's macro catalysts.",
