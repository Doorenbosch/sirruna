        "the_session": "Today's session was deceptively quiet. Bitcoin oscillated in a $1,500 range around $91,000, but beneath the surface, derivatives markets showed unusual activity. The character was consolidation, not conviction—a market catching its breath after last week's volatility.",
        "the_flows": "ETF flows painted a mixed picture: BlackRock's IBIT saw $124 million in inflows while Grayscale's GBTC continued its slow bleed with $45 million out. Net positive, but barely. More telling was perpetual funding rates flipping negative mid-session for the first time this week, suggesting leveraged longs have been flushed. Stablecoin flows into exchanges picked up in the final two hours—someone is positioning.",
        "the_divergence": "The interesting anomaly: ETH outperformed BTC by nearly 2% despite no obvious catalyst. When ETH leads in a risk-off environment, it often signals rotation rather than retreat. Meanwhile, BTC dominance ticked down 0.3%—small, but noteworthy given the broader caution.",
        "the_regime_check": "Nothing fundamental changed today. This morning's thesis—that the market is in distribution mode after November's rally—remains intact. The lack of follow-through buying on the early session dip confirms institutional hesitation. We're still in wait-and-see territory.",
        "the_overnight_setup": "Watch the $90,000 level overnight. Asia opens with BTC just above this psychological floor. A break below likely triggers stop-losses that could accelerate toward $87,500. Conversely, holding $90K and reclaiming $92,000 would suggest the consolidation is constructive rather than distributive.",
        "the_takeaway": "Today was a pause, not a resolution. The real move is still ahead—likely this week."
