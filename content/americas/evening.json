    "the_session": "\u2022 Bitcoin traded in a narrow band around $92,500 through the US session, holding essentially flat over 24 hours despite broader risk-off sentiment \u2014 the kind of consolidation that suggests neither conviction nor capitulation from current holders.\n\n\u2022 Ethereum underperformed notably, shedding 3.2% to $3,231 and widening the performance gap with Bitcoin that has defined recent weeks; the ETH/BTC ratio continues to compress as capital rotates toward the market leader.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin dominance ticked up to 57.2%, reinforcing the flight-to-quality dynamic within crypto that typically characterizes uncertain macro environments \u2014 altcoins are being treated as higher-beta plays to shed, not accumulate.\n\n\u2022 Solana slipped 0.9% to $136, a modest decline relative to Ethereum but still marking its third consecutive session of lower highs \u2014 the momentum that carried it through November appears to be cooling.\n\n\u2022 Total market capitalization contracted marginally to $3.23 trillion, with volume patterns suggesting institutional desks are largely on the sidelines ahead of year-end positioning decisions.",

    "the_macro": "\u2022 The dollar index held near two-year highs heading into Wednesday's session, maintaining pressure on risk assets including crypto as markets price in a more hawkish Fed trajectory through 2025 \u2014 strong currency typically correlates with subdued Bitcoin appetite.\n\n\u2022 Treasury yields remained elevated with the 10-year hovering above 4.4%, reflecting persistent inflation concerns that have tempered expectations for aggressive rate cuts next year; the higher-for-longer narrative continues to weigh on duration-sensitive assets.\n\n\u2022 European markets closed mixed as traders digested weak German business sentiment data, with the DAX slipping 0.3% \u2014 the eurozone's economic malaise provides little support for global risk appetite.\n\n\u2022 Oil prices stabilized around $69 per barrel after Monday's sharp decline, removing one source of volatility but doing little to shift the broader macro picture that has kept institutional crypto allocators cautious.\n\n\u2022 Gold traded flat near $2,620, suggesting haven demand remains muted despite geopolitical tensions \u2014 a dynamic that typically correlates with range-bound Bitcoin behavior.",
