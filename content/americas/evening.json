    "the_session": "\u2022 Bitcoin traded in a remarkably tight $400 range around $90,400 through US hours, the kind of compressed volatility that typically precedes a directional move \u2014 though the market offered few clues about which way.\n\n\u2022 Ethereum outperformed modestly at +1.7%, reclaiming $3,100 with steady buying through the afternoon session; the ETH/BTC ratio ticked higher for the third consecutive day, suggesting some rotation into the second-largest asset.\n\n\u2022 Solana added 0.9% to trade at $133, continuing its quiet recovery from last week's network congestion concerns \u2014 volume remained subdued but spot buying dominated over derivatives activity.\n\n\u2022 The Fear & Greed Index held at 72 (Greed), unchanged from yesterday despite the sideways action; liquidations totaled just $48 million across major exchanges, well below the $150 million daily average of recent weeks.\n\n\u2022 Total market cap edged up 0.5% to $3.17 trillion while BTC dominance slipped marginally to 56.9% \u2014 a modest but notable shift toward altcoins after weeks of Bitcoin-led price action.",

    "the_macro": "\u2022 Markets spent the session positioning ahead of tomorrow's FOMC minutes release, with Treasury yields holding steady and the dollar index flat \u2014 the kind of pre-event paralysis that tends to suppress crypto volatility.\n\n\u2022 US equity indices closed mixed, with the S&P 500 down 0.2% and the Nasdaq flat, as investors digested mixed retail earnings and awaited clarity on the Fed's December rate path.\n\n\u2022 The CME FedWatch tool now prices a 59% probability of a December rate cut, down from 62% last week \u2014 the gradual repricing has yet to materially impact crypto correlations but bears watching.\n\n\u2022 European Central Bank officials struck a cautious tone on further rate cuts, with board member Isabel Schnabel warning that inflation risks remain tilted to the upside \u2014 a reminder that global monetary policy divergence could complicate crypto's macro narrative.\n\n\u2022 Gold traded flat at $2,620 while crude oil slipped 1.2% on demand concerns, leaving Bitcoin's correlation to traditional safe havens effectively neutral for the session.",
