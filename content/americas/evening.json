    "the_session": "Bitcoin spent the US session grinding sideways just beneath the psychologically significant $90,000 level, with price action confined to a narrow $800 range. The modest 0.7% gain masks what was effectively a holding pattern as traders squared positions ahead of the weekend. Volume declined notably from Thursday's levels, suggesting conviction remains scarce at these elevated prices. Equity markets provided little directional impetus, with the S&P 500 closing marginally higher on mixed economic signals. The session's defining characteristic was not movement but its absence\u2014a market catching its breath after November's explosive rally, neither eager to chase nor willing to capitulate.",
    "the_session_title": "Consolidation Defines a Cautious Friday",
    "the_flows": "Spot Bitcoin ETF flows cooled Friday but maintained their positive trajectory. Net inflows across the eleven US products totaled an estimated $142 million, with BlackRock's IBIT capturing the lion's share at approximately $95 million. Fidelity's FBTC added $38 million while Ark's ARKB contributed $22 million. Grayscale's GBTC saw modest outflows of $13 million, continuing its gradual bleed but at a pace that no longer threatens market stability.\n\nThe week's cumulative picture tells a more compelling story: approximately $1.8 billion in net inflows across five trading days, representing sustained institutional appetite despite Bitcoin's proximity to all-time highs. Exchange data shows spot reserves continuing their multi-month decline, with roughly 8,400 BTC leaving centralized platforms this week. On-chain metrics reveal accumulation addresses adding to positions, while short-term holder supply remains stable\u2014a pattern consistent with distribution from traders to longer-duration holders.",
    "the_flows_title": "ETF Inflows Moderate But Remain Constructive",
    "the_divergence": "The session's most notable divergence was Ethereum's complete failure to participate in Bitcoin's modest gains. ETH printed a flat zero percent return while BTC edged higher, widening the performance gap that has characterized recent weeks. The ETH/BTC ratio continues its grind lower, now threatening levels not seen since early 2021.\n\nSolana's slight underperformance (-0.6%) against a rising tide also warrants attention, particularly given its recent outperformance cycle. More curious still: Bitcoin's correlation with the Nasdaq, which had tightened considerably through November, showed signs of decoupling Friday as tech stocks rallied more decisively. Whether this represents noise or signal remains unclear, but the breakdown of the \"risk-on beta\" trade that defined Q4 would carry meaningful implications for positioning frameworks.",
    "the_divergence_title": "Ethereum's Stall Raises Questions",
    "the_regime_check": "The structural regime remains unchanged: Bitcoin sits in a confirmed bull market with price above all major moving averages and institutional flows supportive. However, momentum indicators are flashing amber. The 14-day RSI has retreated from overbought territory and now hovers near 58\u2014healthy, but no longer screaming strength. Funding rates across perpetual markets have normalized from last week's elevated levels, reducing the immediate risk of a leverage flush but also removing a tailwind.\n\nBTC dominance at 57.1% suggests capital rotation into altcoins remains limited, a characteristic of mature bull phases rather than speculative frenzies. The market is not breaking down, but neither is it building the energy required for the next leg higher. Call it consolidation; call it digestion. Either way, patience is being tested.",
    "the_regime_check_title": "Bull Market Intact, Momentum Fading",
    "the_overnight_setup": "The handoff to Asia arrives with Bitcoin testing $90,000 resistance from below. Key levels to monitor: $89,200 serves as immediate support, with $87,500 representing the more significant floor where buyers have consistently emerged. A sustained break above $90,500 would likely trigger momentum algorithms and open the path toward retesting November's highs near $93,500.\n\nPotential catalysts are limited but not absent. South Korean trading volumes have been notably elevated in recent sessions, and any weekend regulatory commentary from Asian authorities could move markets. More likely, the overnight session delivers more of Friday's theme: range-bound price action with occasional probes of key levels. Liquidity thins considerably after Tokyo's close, making Sunday evening particularly vulnerable to sharp moves on minimal volume.",
    "the_overnight_setup_title": "Asian Session Holds the Weekend Keys",
    "the_takeaway": "Today revealed a market that has accepted $90,000 as fair value but lacks the conviction to push meaningfully higher. Institutional flows remain supportive, structure is sound, but momentum is on pause. The next directional move will require a catalyst this session did not provide.",
