        "fulcrum": "Friday's jobs report looms as the macro fulcrum. Weak data strengthens the rate-cut case and likely supports risk assets; strong data gives the Fed cover to pause. Either outcome moves crypto—the question is direction.",
        "levels": "BTC $82,000 is the line. Below it, momentum traders capitulate and the next support is $75,000. Above $92,000, shorts get squeezed and the narrative flips back to bull. ETH $3,000 is psychological—losing it confirms rotation out of alts continues.",
        "unpriced": "Stablecoin supply is quietly expanding while prices fall. USDT market cap hit a new all-time high this week. This divergence historically precedes accumulation phases. The market focuses on price; smart money watches liquidity.",
        "wildcard": "MicroStrategy's inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 on December 23 could create forced buying from index funds. The reflexive loop may have one more chapter left to write."
