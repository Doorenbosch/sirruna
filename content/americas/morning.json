        "overnight": "November's $3.5 billion ETF outflow wasn't just profit-taking—it was the institutional bid stepping away. Bitcoin's 6% overnight decline to $85,945 reveals what happens when algorithmic momentum strategies all hit the same exit.",
        "the_setup": "The US session inherits a market searching for new buyers. ETF flows turned negative for the first time in three weeks, and the options market has flipped to put-heavy positioning. The $95,000 level—previously support—now acts as resistance.",
        "what_matters": "Fed Chair Powell speaks at 14:00 EST. Markets are pricing 65% odds of a December cut, but any hawkish surprise could accelerate the de-risking. Watch the ETF flow data at market close—two consecutive outflow days would confirm distribution.",
        "the_take": "The bull market isn't over, but the easy phase is. What comes next requires patience and conviction that most retail participants don't have."
